A cross-platform mobile application where the user picks a number, and the device tries to guess it using a smart algorithm. Built with **React Native** and **Expo**.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This project is built for **educational purposes** following the *"React Native - The Practical Guide"* course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy. It is not an original product concept but a practical implementation of course materials.

## 🚀 Features

* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on different screen sizes and orientations (Portrait & Landscape).
* **Adaptive UI:** Platform-specific adjustments for iOS and Android components.
* **Game Logic:** Implements a recursive binary-search-like algorithm to guess the number efficiently.
* **Custom Components:** Built using reusable components with advanced styling techniques (Style Merging).
* **Safe Area Views:** Optimized for modern devices with notches (iPhone X+).
